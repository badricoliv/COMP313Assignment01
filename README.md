Assignment 1
First Person Pacman

The main action of the game is to explore the maze and collect all 8 of the pellets

The hardest thing to implement was the ghosts walking through the maze. I had to come up with many types of solutions before settling on having a checker at each intersection and corner.

The most interesting part is that since the game is first person, you have to be careful where you go, since you don't know where the ghosts are in the maze.
